      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document represents a user guide highlighting what the ASC
        (Application Security Control) Project has to offer as features. You can
        explore functionalities like viewing the current vulnerabilities, get
        real-time notifications when a new vulnerability occurs, view
        preventions for vulnerabilities and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to check out the technical documentation, you can do that by
        clicking
        <a href="https://asc-documentation.netlify.app" target="_blank">here</a
        >. For the entire code of the application you can click

    <section id="signin">
      <h2>2. Sign in page</h2>
      <p>
        Once you accessed the application, you should end up on the page
        presented in the following picture.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/sign-in.PNG" alt="signin" />
      <small class="image-info">Sign in page</small>
      <p>
        In this page you can choose between two possible flows: sign in with
        email and password or sign in with Google.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to sign in with email and password, after you complete the
        inputs you can press the "SIGN IN" button to proceed. If you have an
        account, you'll be redirected to the vulnerabilities page, otherwise an
        error will appear. If you don't have an account you can click on the
        "Don't have an account? Sign Up." button to go to the sign up page.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to sign in with Google, you can do that by pressing the
        "LOGIN WITH GOOGLE" button. Once pressed you havce to complete the promp
        from Google and select the account. If you don't have an account with
        that email address, an account will be created and you'll be redirected
        to the vulnerabilities page.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="signup">
      <h2>3. Sign up page</h2>
      <p>
        In this page you can create new account and use them to sign in into the
        application.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/sign-up.PNG" alt="signup" />
      <small class="image-info">Sign up page</small>
      <p>
        The Sign up page has four basic inputs: name, email (which will be used
        for authentication) and the password fields. In order to allow the user
        to create his account, the password fields must match. Once the fields
        are completed, you can press the "SIGN UP" button. After the process of
        creating the account is finished successfully, you will be redirected to
        the login page.

    <section id="vulnerabilities">
      <h2>4. Vulnerabilities page</h2>
      <p>
        Once the user is authenticated, he is redirected to the Vulnerabilities
        page. The vulnerabilities are structured in the form of a table with the
        following columns: id, description, type of the vulnerability, platform
        on which the vulnerability can happen, published is the date when the
        issue was first detected, verified is true if the vulnerability was
        confirmed to be malicious, port and more importantly, the risk which
        represents the level of impact of each security issue.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/vulnerabilities.png" alt="vulnerabilities" />

    </section>
    <section id="vulnerabilities-filter">
      <h2>4.1 Filtering & sorting</h2>
      <p>
        There are several options of filtering the vulnerabilities from the
        table. You can sort each column either in ascending, either in
        descending order, you can hide or show some columns or you can filter
        them based some custom criteria.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/vulnerabilities-1.png" alt="vulnerabilities" />
      <small class="image-info">Vulnerabilities page</small>
      <p>
        For example, as you can see in the second picture below, we removed the
        Verified and Port columns by unchecking the columns.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/vulnerabilities-2.png" alt="vulnerabilities" />
      <small class="image-info">Vulnerabilities page</small>
      <p>
        For more advanced filtering options, you can filter by each column by
        using an operator by choice: contains, equals, starts with, ends with,
        is empty or is not empty. In the case below, we were interested in
        finding all the vulnerabilities related to authentication so we selected
        that the description must contain the keyword "authentication".

    <section id="vulnerabilities-notifications">
      <h2>4.2 Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        Everytime a new security issue is detected and added into the
        application, you will be notified in realtime about it and the interface
        will be updated accordingly to contain the latest vulnerabilities. This
        way, you will always be aware and you will be able to minimize the
        impact in case of a high severity vulnerability.

    <section id="reports">
      <h2>5. Reports page</h2>
      <p>
        This page provides various solutions like technical reports and
        defensive programming guidelines to help preventing some security
        issues. Each report has a title, the platform on which it can occur, a
        concise and clear description regarding the issue and a list of related
        keywords. The more recent updates regarding web application security are
        covered by
        <a
          href="https://owasp.org/Top10/"
          target="_blank"

      <h2>5.1 Filtering</h2>
      <p>
        Moreover, the reports can be as well filtered by platform and you are
        also able to search based on keywords matching the title, the
        description of the list of keywords from each report.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, by clicking on a vulnerability you can identify related
        techincal reports and links about the vulnerability in cause. The
        returned reports must match either the platform of the vulnerability or
        title, either its content contains keywords from the vulnerability's
        description. In the picture below, the "Odine Solutions GateKeeper 10
        trafficCycle SQL Injection" was previously selected. As a result, five
        related reports were identified on multiple platforms and having several
        keywords in common.

      <h2>6. Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        To conclude, the current application represents a solution useful for
        any developer who is interested in keeping their applications secure and
        who want to be aware of the latest security issues and prevention
        methods. As for the future work, we propose enhancing the available
        information regarding the vulnerabilities and related technical reports,
        pieces of advice and defensive programming guidelines.
