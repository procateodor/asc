      <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        ASC (Application Security Control) is a web platform able to offer
        real-time alerts about new security issues for a specific class of
        software like CMS, frameworks, modules, shopping cart managers, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wish to develop a smart platform which will be able to provide an
        innovative mean to find the most dangerous vulnerabilities on the web,
        in order to be up to date with the latest fixes and patches. Or
        secondary goal is to facilitate the process through which our users can
        learn how to prevent an eventual attack, how to determine if they are
        scammed and how to fix a possible vulnerability. All of the provided
        functionalities are presented in a user-friendly maner through a web
        interface, whilst offerint a powerful tool not only for experienced
        developers but also for rookies.

      <h2>2. Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        In the first section we briefly described the main goals of the
        application. The architecture has two main components: a front-end part,
        for the client interaction, built over Angular framework and a back-end
        component implemented in NodeJs, designed following a few well known
        paradigms and hosted by using various resources provided by the AWS
        Cloud Platform. These two components will communicate over the HTTP
        protocol, using the JSON and its extension JSON-LD as the established
        data exchange format. The client will build JSON requests to send
        requests toward the backend component, while the received responses will
        be in the JSON-LD format. In the frontend implementation, we'll have a
        module for JSON-LD to HTML+RDFa, in order to have semantic data encoded
        right in our single page application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web services conglomerate provides a variety of functionalities,
        such as getting a list containg the latest vulnerabilities, finding the
        most suitable fix or patch for a certain vulnerability and real-time
        notifications about new vulnerabilities found and an endpoint via SPARQL
        to provide various solution to prevent and/or eradicate such security
        incidents. More details about each component's particular behaviour can
        be seen in the corresponding sections from below.

      <h2>2.1 Back-end Component</h2>
      <p>The Back-end Component Architecture is built over 'REST' paradigm.</p>
      <p>
        <a

          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >REST</a
        >
        or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for
        providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it
        easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant
        systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are
        stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.
      </p>
      <p>This module is composed of the following components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proxy"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Proxy</a
          >
          - Its role is to receive the requests from the users and check if
          there is a cached response that can be sent back or redirect the
          request to the api and cache the response when it comes back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://redis.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Redis</a
          >
          - Its role is to cache the responses for better performance in the
          app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >API</a
          >
          - Its role is to secure a unique point of access to all
          functionalities for the web client to call. From the API, the request
          can go two ways: either to the authentication flow (if the user is not
          logged in, therefore he does not have a JWT token) or to the
          authorization flow (if the user has a JWT token and therefore is
          already authenticated).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.mongodb.com"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >MongoDB</a
          >
          - Its role is to save the active users data. This will be used in the
          Authentication flow to insert an active user and will be further
          consulted by the Authorization flow to validate the authenticity of
          the JWT token.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >SparQL Query Runner Endpoint</a
          >
          - This component is in charge of transforming the received parameters
          in lambdas (through requests) in various SparQL queries, depending on
          which data source we need to interogate. Once the response is received
          in the lambda from GraphDB, it will be sent as JSON-LD back to the
          client.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a summary, the API offer the main functionalities, being the core
        elements of our architecture provides an unique point of access for the
        web client. The API communicate with data sources represented as
        ontologies for vulnerabilities. The query language for accessing the
        datasources is SparQL and the communication contract established between
        the client and the services provider is a mix between JSON (used for
        request) and JSON-LD (sent through responses).

      <h2>2.2 Front-end Component</h2>
      <p>
        The user interface will be created using the Angular framework combined
        with Material Design, which is ideal for building single-page
        applications. Angular Material is an implementation of Google's Material
        Design Specification (2014-2017). This project provides a set of
        reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components for AngularJS
        developers. The web interface will be hosted in Netlify, in order to
        communicate easily with the other components of the project. The data
        which is used to populate the web page in specific context is received
        either in the JSON format or its extension JSON-LD. For the latter,
        we'll use a parser to transform it in HTML+RDFa format, which will be
        loaded into the page using custom built Angular directives.
